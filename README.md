# uci-ai-java
> neural net for uci digit categorisation

## Requirements
````java
Java17 SDK (openjdk 17lts)
JavaFX (openjfx 17lts)
EclipseIDE (or jvm and javac)
````

````
train neural net adjusting layers sizes weights and bias
label datasets with 8x8 binary pixel shade for handwritted digits
train on dataset by caculating result, backproping diff and adjusting weight for accuracy
then test on another dataset
main example takes 2 datasets to perform twofold testing
